This is a Ruby On Rails application that allows a user to authenticate with
Twitter using OAuth.  Once, the user and then be able to post Tweets and retrieve
Tweets using Twitters API.

To get this to work, I had to log into Twitter and create an App.  This generated
access tokens and provider keys that this RoR app uses to be able to post and
request Tweets for the signed in user.

Prior to running the rails server, please define the following environment variables:

OMNIAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN
OMNIAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
OMNIAUTH_PROVIDER_KEY
OMNIAUTH_PROVIDER_SECRET

For default username, set optional environment variable:
OMNIAUTH_DEFAULT_USERNAME

When we request Tweets from Twitter, we persist them to local SQLite database.

When user posts a Tweet, I am persisting the tweet to the database with a special
tweet id.  When retrieving Tweets, detect if the Tweet we tried posting did not
get posted and retry.
